# Nearest neighbors search in the Tiny Images dataset

The Tiny Images dataset consists of 79,302,017 images, each being a 32x32 color RGB image.
The images have been retrieved from the Internet from several image search engines,
are stored in an uncompressed large binary file (227GB) so that each image can be easily
accessed via random access and are loosely labeled with one of the 75,062 non-abstract
nouns in English as listed in the Wordnet lexical database. 

As shown in the paper "80 million tiny images: a large dataset for non-parametric object and scene recognition" 
[here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/billf/www/papers/80millionImages.pdf) this dataset can be used for some quite
interesting tasks like scene detection, object detection and localization and image annotation.

This repository contains the scripts and source code that have been used for the
blog post [here](http://daniel-e.github.io/2016-01-05-nearest-neighbor-in-tiny-images-dataset/).
